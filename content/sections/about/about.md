"No amount of testing can prove a software right, a single test can prove a software wrong"          -Amir Ghahrai

Currently studying computer engineering I was always curious to know how things work and after multiple years of engineering, I have a basic understanding of the most fundamental technology. I have realized how much more there is to learn and grow, the possibilities are endless. I'm a competitive person curious to learn more about new technologies.
Currently learning about Full Stack applications. Some of my interesting projects were in Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Systems and Computer Organization. I like to play table tennis in my leisure time and I love sketching.
